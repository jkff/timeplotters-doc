Timeplotters: two tools for visualizing logs and temporal data                                                         

=== Introduction ===
    timeplot draws xxx
    splot draws yyy

Goal is to aid exploration => generatable input, fast

Example images: [IMG] [IMG]

Input in strict format.
Pattern of usage: [IMG]

In shell: awk; splot

Let's look at an example without detail.

Computational cluster using splot.
Log looks like this.
awk ...; splot ...
You see it's just 2 commands.
It's interesting, see section X.

tplot is also used like this.

=== tplot ===
Show temporal data, spot patterns.

Input: happened, started, value. See section X.
Output: stack of plots; 1-1, but can be more complex. See section Y.

Example: [IMG]

= Simple example =
Dot plot.
Program accesses db server.
Log looks like this:
   ... duration is 100 ms
We want to look at durations.

Generate trace:
  ...
Use awk:
  ...

Generate output:
  ...

Here, -dk means default kind. See section X.

We get this:
[IMG]

We see the following anomalies:
  * ...

= Where to go next =
  * complex example, track mapping, event types, chart types, gallery

= Training example =
!!! TODO !!!

== Motivation: complex example ==
Here we'll look at an interesting example but not explain anything.
Look at that same log with memcached access.
Suppose we have N racks and 1 memcached. Compare latencies.
Log looks like this:
  ...
Let's make a trace:
  ...
We get:
  ...
Track names are different processes.
Now plot:
  ...
Nevermind the command, look how cool it is.
[IMG]

Explanation of output:
  ...

Graphs differ:
  ...

To reiterate: given the log, commands
 ...
give a graph.

This showed ease of use and power of tplot.

== Concepts ==
Necessary for understanding the rest. Skim and return later.
Event, Input track, Output track, Output plot, Track mapping, Plot kind, Plot kind mapping,
Together: input transformed to output, output stacked.

Event types: measurement, impulse, edge, counter, interval, duration plot
Pls revisit section Motivation now.

== Input format ==
Examples:
  ..
Syntax / meaning table:
  ..

== Chart kinds ==
= Special kinds =
Empty, Duration, Within
= Numeric kinds =
Dots, lines, sum, cumsum, quantile, binf/binh
= Kinds for counters =
Event, acount, apercent, afreq
= Kinds for discrete data =
freq, hist

== Track and plot kind mapping ==
Algorithm has several steps. We'll show the full algorithm and then explain.
General algorithm:
  ...
Simplest case: 1-1
Multiple inputs, 1 plot type
Multiple inputs, different plot types
Single input, several plot types
Multiple inputs, single plot

== Option reference ==
...

== Gallery ==

=== splot ===
